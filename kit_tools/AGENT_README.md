## Quick Start — Read Order

**For general orientation:**
1. **This file** — How to navigate and update docs
2. **SYNOPSIS.md** — What is this project, current state, tech stack
3. **arch/CODE_ARCH.md** — Code structure, patterns, key abstractions
4. **arch/SERVICE_MAP.md** — Dependencies, external integrations, what calls what

**For troubleshooting:**
5. **docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md** — How to debug, access logs, common fixes
6. **docs/MONITORING.md** — Logs, metrics, alerts, tracing

**For making changes:**
7. **arch/SECURITY.md** — Auth flows, secrets, permissions
8. **docs/GOTCHAS.md** — Known landmines, tech debt, non-obvious behaviors
9. **specs/*.md** — Active feature specs
10. **roadmap/*.md** — MVP milestones and backlog

**For infrastructure:**
11. **arch/INFRA_ARCH.md** — Cloud resources, networking, IAM
12. **docs/CI_CD.md** — Pipeline, deployments

## Session Start Checklist

Before starting any work session:

- [ ] Read `SYNOPSIS.md` to understand current project state
- [ ] Check `specs/*.md` for active feature specs
- [ ] Check `roadmap/MILESTONES.md` for milestone tracking
- [ ] Review `arch/CODE_ARCH.md` for structure and patterns
- [ ] Scan `docs/GOTCHAS.md` for relevant landmines
- [ ] Check `AUDIT_FINDINGS.md` for open findings
- [ ] Check `arch/SERVICE_MAP.md` if working with integrations

**For troubleshooting tasks, also read:**
- [ ] `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for debugging procedures
- [ ] `docs/MONITORING.md` for log access

**Flag anything that looks like:**
- Security concerns → Document in `arch/SECURITY.md`
- Code that violates documented patterns
- Documentation that appears stale or inconsistent with code

## Patterns to Follow

<!--
CUSTOMIZE THIS SECTION: Replace these placeholder examples with actual
patterns from this codebase. Delete categories that don't apply.
-->

### Code Organization
<!-- FILL: Where do different types of code live? -->
- [Pattern 1: e.g., "All API routes go in `/routes/`"]
- [Pattern 2: e.g., "Business logic lives in `/services/`"]
- [Pattern 3: e.g., "Database queries go through `/repositories/`"]

### Naming Conventions
<!-- FILL: How are things named in this project? -->
- [Files: e.g., "snake_case for Python, camelCase for JS"]
- [Classes/Functions: e.g., "PascalCase classes, camelCase functions"]
- [Environment variables: e.g., "SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE"]

### Security Patterns
<!-- FILL: How is security handled? Delete if not applicable -->
- [Input validation: e.g., "All user input validated with..."]
- [SQL: e.g., "Parameterized statements only"]
- [Secrets: e.g., "Never logged, stored in..."]

See `arch/SECURITY.md` for detailed security documentation.

### Error Handling
<!-- FILL: How are errors handled? -->
- [Pattern: e.g., "Custom exception classes in `/exceptions/`"]
- [Logging: e.g., "All errors logged with correlation ID"]
- [User-facing: e.g., "Sanitized of internal details"]

See `arch/patterns/ERROR_HANDLING.md` for details.

## Off-Limits / Requires Human Review

The following changes should be drafted but **not applied** without human approval:

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Update this list based on actual sensitive areas in this project -->

- [ ] **Authentication/Authorization flows** — Security-critical, needs review
- [ ] **Database migrations** — Schema changes can be destructive
- [ ] **Infrastructure changes** — IaC plans need human approval
- [ ] **Dependency updates** — Major version bumps need testing
- [ ] **Files marked `# HUMAN-REVIEW-REQUIRED`** — Explicitly flagged
- [ ] **Secrets or API keys** — Never commit, always use secret management
- [ ] **[Add project-specific sensitive areas]**

When in doubt, ask before applying.

## Documentation Standards

### Required Metadata
Every documentation file should include at the top:

```markdown
# FILENAME.md
> Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD
> Updated by: [Human/Claude]
```

### Cross-References
Link related documentation:
- Security info → `arch/SECURITY.md`
- Environment variables → `docs/ENV_REFERENCE.md`
- Debugging → `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

### Staleness Indicator
If a doc hasn't been updated in 30+ days and the related code has changed, it should be flagged for review.
