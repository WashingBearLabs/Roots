## Overview

<!-- FILL: High-level description of the codebase structure and philosophy -->

[Describe the overall architecture: monolith, microservices, modular monolith, serverless, library, CLI tool, etc.]

The primary design principles are:

1. [Principle 1]
2. [Principle 2]
3. [Principle 3]

## Directory Structure

<!-- FILL: Run `tree -L 2` or similar and document the actual structure -->

```

│   └── [subdirectory]/  # [Purpose]
├── [directory]/         # [Purpose]
└── kit_tools/           # Documentation and tooling
```

---

## Key Modules

<!-- FILL: Document the main modules/packages in your codebase -->

| Module | Purpose | Key Files |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `[module]/` | [What it does] | `[key_file]` |
| `[module]/` | [What it does] | `[key_file]` |

---

## Data Flow

<!-- FILL: Describe how data moves through the system. Delete if not applicable (e.g., for libraries) -->

```
[Request/Input]
       │
       ▼
[Component A]
       │
       ▼
[Component B]
       │
       ▼
[Response/Output]
```

## Key Patterns

<!-- FILL: Document the main patterns used. Delete sections that don't apply -->

### Authentication Flow
<!-- Delete if no auth -->
[Describe auth flow, or delete this section]

See `arch/SECURITY.md` for detailed security documentation.

See `arch/patterns/ERROR_HANDLING.md` for details.

### Logging
[Describe logging approach]

See `arch/patterns/LOGGING.md` for details.

| [Worker name] | [Queue name] | [Message type] | `[file path]` |

### Scheduled Tasks

| Task | Schedule | Purpose |

## Caching Strategy

<!-- FILL: Where and how caching is used. Delete if no caching -->

### Cache Locations

| Cache | Technology | Purpose | TTL |

| [Name] | [Redis / Memory / etc.] | [What's cached] | [Duration] |

### Cache Keys

| Pattern | Example | Used For |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `[pattern]` | `[example]` | [What it caches] |

### Cache Invalidation

```
# How/when caches are invalidated
[Description or code example]
```

### Cache Patterns

## Important Classes / Functions

<!-- FILL: List the most important code artifacts an AI should know about -->

| Name | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `[name]` | `[path/to/file]` | [What it does] |
