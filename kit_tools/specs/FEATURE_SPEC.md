# Feature Spec: {{FEATURE_TITLE}}

## Overview

{{Brief description of the feature and the problem it solves. What pain point does this address? Why are we building this now?}}

## Goals

- {{Specific, measurable objective 1}}
- {{Specific, measurable objective 2}}
- {{Specific, measurable objective 3}}

## User Stories

<!--
SESSION-FIT GUIDELINES:
- Each story should complete in one focused session (single context window)
- 3-5 acceptance criteria per story (clear, verifiable)
- Order by dependency: schema → backend → UI
- Stories are refined during planning to ensure session-fit
- Implementation Hints give the implementing agent a head start (key files, patterns, gotchas)

Story count is not a target — what matters is that each story:
- Has single responsibility (one concern)
- Is session-fit (completable in one context window)
- Has clear, verifiable acceptance criteria
- Has implementation hints (3-5 bullet points of guidance)
-->

### US-001: {{Story Title}}

**Description:** As a {{user type}}, I want {{feature/capability}} so that {{benefit/outcome}}.

**Implementation Hints:**
- {{Key file path or module to modify}}
- {{Existing pattern or function to follow/use}}
- {{Relevant gotcha or constraint}}

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] {{Specific, verifiable criterion}}
- [ ] {{Another criterion}}
- [ ] Tests written/updated for new functionality
- [ ] Full test suite passes
- [ ] Typecheck/lint passes
<!-- For UI stories, add: -->
<!-- - [ ] Verify in browser -->
<!-- For doc/config-only stories, remove the test criteria above -->
