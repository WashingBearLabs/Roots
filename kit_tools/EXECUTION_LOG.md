### US-001: Project Scaffolding (Attempt 1) — PASS
- Completed: 2026-03-24T01:42:06Z
- Verified by: independent verifier session
- Learnings: Pyright strict mode flags errors in kit_tools/hooks/ Python files but roots/ and tests/ pass cleanly; Ruff has one pre-existing error in kit_tools/hooks/validate_setup.py — not from scaffolding; hatchling used as build backend for editable installs; Verifier note: All 6 acceptance criteria are met. The scaffolding is clean and complete. Minor note: typer 0.23.1 does not provide the 'all' extra (warning during install), but this does not affect functionality or any criterion.

### US-002: Base Node Model and NodeType Enum (Attempt 1) — PASS
- Completed: 2026-03-24T01:45:20Z
- Verified by: independent verifier session
- Learnings: Pydantic model_validator(mode='after') with Self return type works well for cross-field validation; Using TYPE_CHECKING guard for Self import avoids runtime issues while satisfying pyright strict mode; from __future__ import annotations needed to allow forward references in model_validator return types; Verifier note: Implementation is clean and follows the spec exactly. All models use Pydantic with model_validator(mode='after'). BackoffStrategy and OnExhaustion are correctly separated as StrEnum types. Tests are thorough with parametrized coverage of all non-agent node types.

### US-003: Agent, AgentPool, and Decision Config Models (Attempt 1) — PASS
- Completed: 2026-03-24T01:47:38Z
- Verified by: independent verifier session
- Learnings: Pydantic model_validator(mode='after') with Self return type works well for cross-field validation; Empty string condition treated as falsy for deterministic mode edge validation; Verifier note: Implementation is clean and follows the spec precisely. All models, enums, and validators match the implementation hints. Tests are thorough with good edge case coverage including empty string conditions and threshold boundary checks.

### US-004: Remaining Config Models and Type-Discriminated Node Parsing (Attempt 1) — PASS
- Completed: 2026-03-24T01:51:18Z
- Verified by: independent verifier session
- Learnings: NodeDefinition.config type changed from dict[str, Any] to dict[str, Any] | BaseModel to support both dict and typed config models; isinstance(self.config, dict) guard in model_validator prevents re-parsing already-typed configs passed programmatically; Exception wrapping in config validator adds node ID and type context for better error messages; Verifier note: Implementation is clean and complete. All 5 config models match the spec exactly. The CONFIG_MAP discriminator with isinstance guard handles both dict and pre-typed configs correctly. Error messages include node ID and type for debugging. Test coverage is thorough with 73 passing tests.

### US-005: Edge Model and Process Definition Model (Attempt 1) — PASS
- Completed: 2026-03-24T01:54:15Z
- Verified by: independent verifier session
- Learnings: Pydantic Field(alias='from') with ConfigDict(populate_by_name=True) allows both 'from' and 'from_node' for YAML/Python compat; Pyright flags aliased field names as unknown parameters — runtime works fine with populate_by_name=True but pyright sees only the alias; model_dump(by_alias=True, mode='json') serializes using alias names (from/to) for round-trip YAML compatibility; Private _node_map built in model_validator(mode='after') provides O(1) node lookups for get_node and validation; Verifier note: Clean implementation matching the spec exactly. EdgeDefinition uses proper alias handling with populate_by_name. ProcessDefinition validator correctly builds _node_map and validates all references. Helper methods correctly dispatch between decision config edges and top-level edges. All 95 tests pass.

### US-006: YAML Parsing Pipeline (Attempt 1) — PASS
- Completed: 2026-03-24T01:58:05Z
- Verified by: independent verifier session
- Learnings: yaml.safe_load returns Any type - use cast() to satisfy pyright strict mode when narrowing via isinstance; Pydantic ValidationError.errors() returns dicts with 'loc' tuples and 'msg' strings - loc[0]=='nodes' and loc[1] being int indicates a node-level error; Node-level validation errors from Pydantic may be wrapped by the NodeDefinition model_validator, so the loc path may not always reach into node config fields directly; Verifier note: Implementation is clean and follows the spec closely. All three public functions (load_process_yaml, parse_process_dict, validate_process_yaml) are implemented correctly. Minor cosmetic note: node-level error messages have duplicated context (once from _format_validation_errors, once from NodeDefinition.validate_node in schema.py), but this doesn't affect correctness. Full test suite passes with 112 tests and no regressions.

### US-007: Structural Validator — Basic Rules (Attempt 1) — PASS
- Completed: 2026-03-24T02:01:44Z
- Verified by: independent verifier session
- Learnings: Unreachable node detection uses BFS that follows both top-level edges and decision config edges for full graph traversal; Join nodes are exempt from edge completeness checks alongside end and decision nodes; validate_process_yaml returns structural errors directly (list), while load_process_yaml raises ProcessValidationError; Verifier note: Clean implementation. All 33 tests pass (including pre-existing US-006 tests). Error messages match spec exactly. ProcessValidationError properly defined with errors attribute. Integration into load_process_yaml and validate_process_yaml is correct — structural validation runs after Pydantic validation. Reachability BFS correctly follows both top-level edges and decision config edges. Warnings use the warnings module as specified, keeping them separate from errors.

### US-008: Structural Validator — Fork/Join Pairing (Attempt 1) — PASS
- Completed: 2026-03-24T02:05:48Z
- Verified by: independent verifier session
- Learnings: Fork/join validation reuses the adjacency dict already built for reachability BFS in validate_structure; recompute_fork_join_map delegates to validate_structure via lazy import to avoid circular imports between schema.py and validator.py; fork_join_map is a regular Pydantic field (not underscore-prefixed) so it survives serialization; Verifier note: Implementation is clean and correct. All 42 tests pass. Minor note: load_process_yaml calls parse_process_dict (which runs validate_structure via recompute_fork_join_map) and then calls validate_structure again — double validation is a minor inefficiency but not a correctness issue.
